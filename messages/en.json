    "q1_0": "KOFLY? I only know you as GLEITSCHIRM-TANDEMFLUG.COM!",
    "a1_0": "There was always some confusion about the name, so we came up with a short and simple brand name for our offer. GLEITSCHIRM-TANDEMFLUG.COM is now called KOFLY, but is still available at GLEITSCHIRM-TANDEMFLUG.COM!",
    "q1_1": "How does the enquiry process work?",
    "a1_1": "You can reach us via the website form, by email, or ideally via WhatsApp or phone at +43 676 7293888, since we plan around the weather. We\u2019ll get back to you promptly, give you a brief overview of the flight experience in the Airpark Lienzer Dolomiten, and highlight our expertise and safety standards. Together, we\u2019ll go over your preferences: preferred date, number of people, weight, age, any health considerations, and whether you\u2019d like to use a voucher. This way, we can prepare your flight in the best possible way.",
    "q1_2": "How do I schedule an appointment?",
    "a1_2": "Paragliding is only possible in safe weather conditions. Shortly before your holiday, it\u2019s best to get in touch after our daily weather briefing (approx. 6\u20137\u2009pm) by phone or WhatsApp. We\u2019ll then send you all the details: available dates, the current weather report, and practical tips. You\u2019ll receive a provisional reservation; 1\u20132 days before the flight, we check the weather once more and confirm the final appointment via WhatsApp or phone. Please note: we only fly in suitable conditions \u2013 and if the weather doesn\u2019t cooperate, we reschedule free of charge. Your safety always comes first.",
    "q1_3": "Can I reschedule my appointment for free?",
    "a1_3": "Yes. If the weather doesn\u2019t cooperate, we\u2019ll reschedule or cancel your appointment free of charge. You take no risk.",
    "q1_4": "How does the voucher work?",
    "a1_4": "If you\u2019d like to give a voucher as a gift, you can pick it up in person or have it sent by post. After ordering, we\u2019ll send you the voucher along with information material and confirm everything via email or WhatsApp. We clearly communicate the voucher\u2019s validity period. Scheduling remains flexible: you choose your flight date. If the weather changes, you can reschedule free of charge.",
    "q2_1": "What are the requirements for a tandem flight?",
    "a2_1": "You don\u2019t need any prior experience. A minimum age of around 4 years is possible; children can fly upon request. You should have normal to good physical fitness and be able to take a few brisk steps during take-off. The ideal weight is up to 110\u202Fkg, up to 120\u202Fkg upon request. As a guideline, a BMI of 27 applies. Acute heart conditions or severe back problems are exclusion criteria. Safety is our top priority \u2013 please let us know if you have any limitations, such as a hip replacement, post-operative restrictions, epilepsy, or a strong susceptibility to motion sickness or seasickness.",
    "q2_2": "What is the weight limit?",
    "a2_2": "Ideally between 20\u202Fkg and 110\u202Fkg, up to 120\u202Fkg upon request. As a guideline, a BMI of 27 applies. It\u2019s important that you can take a few brisk steps during take-off. Landing usually requires no running, as we land gently in a seated position.",
    "q2_3": "Am I too old or too young?",
    "a2_3": "You\u2019re only as old as you feel. Anyone who is generally healthy and can take a few steady, brisk steps is welcome to fly with us. Children can fly upon request depending on their development and weight \u2013 generally from around 30\u202Fkg, with written parental consent.",
    "q2_4": "What should I bring to my tandem flight appointment?",
    "a2_4": "Depending on the season, warm, windproof clothing: a jacket, long trousers, and sturdy ankle-high shoes. Optionally, gloves (we provide heated gloves free of charge upon request) and sunglasses.",
    "q3_1": "What flight packages are available?",
    "a3_1": "You can choose from several packages: The Classic Flight without photo/video (\u20AC150) is the standard tandem flight. The Classic Flight with photo/video (\u20AC170) combines the flight with professional footage. The Premium Flight (\u20AC190) is a specially curated premium experience with more time for the ascent, briefing, and flight. The Thermal Flight (\u20AC250) is designed for suitable thermal conditions and is particularly varied. You can optionally add photos/videos to any package (+\u20AC20) if not already included.",
    "q3_2": "Go Premium! Why?",
    "a3_2": "With the Classic tandem paragliding flight, you\u2019ll enjoy an unforgettable flight time of at least 20 to 30 minutes. Several flights are conducted one after another depending on pilot availability. A photo and video package is optionally available for 20\u202F\u20AC.\n\nThe Premium tandem paragliding flight is an exclusive experience tailored to your wishes. You get more time for the ascent, briefing, and flight \u2013 so you can enjoy your adventure without any rush. With good thermals, you\u2019ll get extra flight time, up to 40 minutes. This package is especially suited for couples and groups; upon request, multiple pilots can fly in parallel. Photos and video on an SD card are included and can be viewed on a tablet after the flight. We\u2019re happy to arrange special requests.",
    "q3_3": "What is the Thermal Tandem Flight?",
    "a3_3": "For the Thermal Flight, we take off from the Steinermandl at Zettersfeld (2,220\u202Fm), usually in the late morning as the thermals begin. Since we can climb significantly higher, warm, windproof clothing, ankle-high shoes, gloves, and sunglasses are essential. The Thermal Flight lasts at least 60 minutes, often longer. If the thermals are noticeably weaker and the flight time is clearly shorter than planned, the pricing will be adjusted accordingly. Since thermals are highly weather-dependent, we cannot guarantee a specific minimum duration 100\u202F%. Please book at least 2 weeks in advance and confirm the appointment by phone at +43 676 72 93 888 1\u20132 days before arrival.",
    "q3_4": "Are there any additional costs?",
    "a3_4": "In addition to the flight package, depending on the season, the ascent is extra: either a taxi in the off-season or the lift ticket from the Lienzer Bergbahnen for the ride up to the Steinermandl (2 sections). Photo/video costs 20\u202F\u20AC if not included in the package.",
    "q3_5": "Do you offer photo and video services?",
    "a3_5": "Yes. For a 20\u202F\u20AC surcharge (if not included in the package), we film and photograph with a GoPro. The footage is reviewed together at the landing site after the flight and then handed over on an SD card. If the material is unavailable or unreadable due to technical issues, the media package will not be charged; liability is excluded. After handover of the SD card, we assume no guarantee for any later issues with the card. If you prefer that we don\u2019t use footage for our website or media, please let us know in advance. Professional post-production with music is available for an additional fee.",
    "q3_6": "What does the Classic Tandem Flight include?",
    "a3_6": "Our launch sites are the Steinermandl at Zettersfeld or Lienz\u2019s local mountain, Hochstein. Flight time is approximately 20\u201330 minutes \u2013 a flight over the Lienz valley floor with the wonderful panorama of the Lienzer Dolomiten, for those who love to savour the moment! The photo & video package is optionally available.",
    "q3_7": "What makes the Premium Tandem Flight special?",
    "a3_7": "\u201EGO PREMIUM\u201C \u2013 with an extra package of time, deceleration, and an unforgettable experience before, during, and after the flight! Flight time is approximately 20\u201345 minutes, and the photo and video package is included. The package with experience guarantee and individual attention \u2013 for discerning passengers!",
    "q3_8": "What does the Thermal Tandem Flight offer?",
    "a3_8": "For all flying enthusiasts who want to experience the Airpark Lienzer Dolomiten beyond the peaks with the power of thermals! Following the motto: Soar with the birds in the thermals and enjoy the experience at 3,000 metres! The photo & video package is optionally available.",
    "q3_9": "What is the Romantic Tandem Flight?",
    "a3_9": "You set off in the late afternoon by taxi to the Hochsteinh\u00FCtte, where a romantic dinner with an overnight stay in the idyllic mountain hut at over 2,000 metres awaits you. After breakfast at sunrise with a magnificent Dolomite panorama, we fly you back down to the valley!",
    "q3_10": "Do you offer individual tandem flight adventures?",
    "a3_10": "Have a special wish? Tandem Hike & Fly, tandem cross-country flight, a marriage proposal in the air, or a special birthday surprise? We organise just about anything! We also arrange tandem flights for larger groups.",
    "q3_11": "What does the photo and video package include in detail?",
    "a3_11": "To make the adventure truly unforgettable, our GoPro is available upon request on every flight for photos and videos. After the flight, you receive the footage conveniently on an SD card to take home! Upon request, we also offer 360\u00B0 videos, livestreaming during the flight, and professionally edited videos.",
    "q4_1": "Where is the meeting point?",
    "a4_1": "Depending on the arrangement, we meet at the Touch Heaven or Bruno Girstmair flight school landing sites, but usually directly at the ticket office of the Lienzer Bergbahnen at the Zettersfeld gondola base station in Gaimberg, or at an agreed meeting point.",
    "q4_2": "Where do we fly?",
    "a4_2": "We fly in Osttirol in the Airpark Lienzer Dolomiten. Depending on the weather, we take off from Zettersfeld or Hochstein.",
    "q4_3": "What can I expect during the tandem flight?",
    "a4_3": "We accompany you with our equipment to the appropriate launch site at Zettersfeld or Hochstein. There, we first take in the stunning scenery and fresh mountain air above 2,000 metres. Your pilot goes through the briefing with you, we fill out the flight ticket, and adjust your comfortable harness. After the final check, we take off with a few brisk steps \u2013 and you feel the ground disappear beneath your feet. The excitement quickly gives way to calm enjoyment. We glide towards the Lienzer Dolomiten \u2013 our motto: \u201ESerotonin statt Adrenalin\u201C (\u201CSerotonin instead of adrenaline\u201C), and upon request, both in perfect harmony. For the landing, depending on the situation, we take a few steps or touch down gently on our airbag. Depending on the flight package, the entire experience takes approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours.",
    "q4_4": "How do I prepare at the launch site?",
    "a4_4": "Before the flight, you\u2019ll receive a brief introduction: you\u2019ll get to know the equipment and receive clear take-off instructions. During the launch run, you run briskly for 5\u201310 metres alongside us. Very important: when you feel the urge to sit down, keep running until we give you the signal to sit. You don\u2019t need any prior experience \u2013 we guide you step by step. Calm, clear communication and safety are our top priorities throughout.",
    "q4_5": "How does the flight go?",
    "a4_5": "Enjoy tandem paragliding in the Airpark Lienzer Dolomiten. Your pilot explains the surroundings during the flight and tailors the experience to you \u2013 as a calm, leisurely glide or, depending on the package and conditions, as a more dynamic thermal flight. If photo/video is booked (or included in the package), we capture your experience. You sit back, breathe deeply, and enjoy the view \u2013 in safe hands.",
    "q4_6": "How does the landing work?",
    "a4_6": "The landing is gentle \u2013 depending on the plan, at the Touch Heaven landing site or at an agreed landing spot nearby. We show you in good time how to lift your feet slightly, and we land together in a seated position on the foam protector/airbag. Afterwards, we briefly discuss the experience. If you booked photo/video, we review the footage right at the landing site. Only once you\u2019ve seen the material and are happy with it do we hand over the SD card. Payment can be made in cash or by prior arrangement via bank transfer/PayPal. And quite deliberately: with us, you can pay after the experience if you wish \u2013 making your flight completely risk-free.",
    "q5_1": "Is tandem paragliding safe?",
    "a5_1": "Yes. Safety is our highest priority. We only fly in suitable, aeronautically safe weather conditions and exclusively with experienced, certified tandem pilots. Our equipment is regularly inspected in accordance with legal requirements. Additionally, we carry the mandatory commercial liability insurance. If not all conditions are met, we don\u2019t take off \u2013 the flight is rescheduled. This way, you can experience your adventure with complete peace of mind.",
    "q5_2": "What happens after the flight?",
    "a5_2": "After the flight, you\u2019ll receive a personal thank-you message from us. We appreciate your feedback and, if you\u2019re satisfied, your recommendation. We\u2019re also happy to tell you about further offerings, such as \u201ESki & Fly\u201C in winter. Our goal is your complete satisfaction.",

    "generalP1": "Daniel Kofler \u2013 Gleitschirm-Tandemflug.com organises and pilots tandem paraglider flights. The company uses only self-employed, experienced, state-licensed tandem pilots who are themselves the entrepreneurs responsible for the execution of the flights and are, as such, the contractual partners of the tandem passengers. Each tandem pilot who carries out a flight is the legally responsible contractual partner.",
    "generalP2": "The liability, responsibility and all services performed are the sole responsibility of the state-tested, licensed pilots who have been booked by Gleitschirm-Tandemflug.com.",
    "generalP3": "The transportation of persons in tandem paragliders and all other services performed by Gleitschirm-Tandemflug.com are subject to Austrian law, especially the air traffic regulations as well as the following conditions.",
    "generalP4": "Before the start of the flight, the tandem passenger (in the case of a child, a legal guardian or an adult escort) must carefully read the transportation contract and confirm his agreement with his signature. Immediately before take-off, the tandem passenger will receive instructions from the pilot about the take-off procedure. If the tandem passenger does not understand the instructions or is unable, for some other reason, to follow the instructions, he must inform the pilot immediately.",
    "bookingTitle": "Booking and payment",
    "bookingP1": "The tandem passenger declares hereby that his participation in a paragliding tandem flight is only because of his personal interest. The expenses for the travel to the airport shall be borne by the tandem passenger. The cost of the mountain lift and similar items are not included in the flight fee. All other travel expenses that arise from weather conditions are, likewise, not included in the price. If the passenger is not present at the agreed-upon departure time for the flight, the entire fee for the flight must be paid by him.",
    "bookingP2": "The execution and course of the flight will be determined by the pilot. The pilot is also always responsible for the successful completion of the flight.",
    "bookingP3": "Please note that, even in the case of an agreed-upon flight time, the passenger has no right to demand the completion of the tandem flight if the weather conditions in the flight area will not allow this to be done safely. In the case of delay of take-off, there will be no right to claim damages, refunds, or the reimbursement of any other costs. The passenger, however, does retain a claim to reimbursement for the price of the flight.",
    "bookingP4": "Cancellations on account of weather conditions do not require an objective justification \u2013 the subjective impression of the responsible pilot is sufficient.",
    "bookingP5": "The flight duration is always dependant on weather conditions and the desired style or type of flight. Because of that, it is not possible to guarantee a standardised flight time. The flight route, the landing place and the flight time may be changed at any time on account of safety or operational considerations. The tandem passenger does not have any claim for compensation of any kind as a result of such changes.",

    "riskP1": "In spite of all appropriate precautions, accidents can occur in paragliding. Our highest goal is to minimise this risk as much as possible.",
    "riskP2": "The passenger must immediately follow the instructions of the pilot at all times. The passenger will receive a theoretical introduction before take-off. If these instructions are not followed during the take-off, flight, and landing, the safety of the pilot and passenger can be endangered.",
    "riskP3": "The pilot can also refuse to allow the passenger to participate in flight operations if the passenger ignores his instructions. If the passenger acts in contravention of these requirements, he no longer has any claim on completion of the tandem flight, and any claim for refund of the flight fees is thereby void. In the case of personal injury caused by not following instructions, the passenger bears the liability. For intentional or grossly negligent damage to the pilot\u2019s equipment or the property of a third party, the liability will be borne by the passenger.",
    "riskP4": "The passenger declares herewith explicitly that he is physically and mentally healthy and confirms that he considers himself to be capable of handling the stresses of the flight.

Gleitschirm-Tandemflug.com disclaims all liability for claims that are greater than the legally specified coverage amounts.",

    "insuranceP4": "Exclusion from or limitation of liability apply, accordingly, for employees, self-employed tandem pilots and representatives of Gleitschirm-Tandemflug.com",
    "insuranceP5": "A damage compensation obligation for pilots of Gleitschirm-Tandemflug.com only exists insofar as damages are caused by grossly negligent or intentional actions/omissions on the part of the tandem pilot. The liability of the carrier is limited to the objects accompanying the passenger up to the maximum amount covered by the contracted insurance policy. Claims that exceed this amount will only be valid in the case of intent or gross negligence.",

In the event of failures of video recording devices and cameras during a tandem flight, the costs of the photo and video package will be refunded in full and there is no legal claim to a repetition of the flight or the video or photo recordings. The photo and video material is normally reviewed and checked on a smartphone with the passenger after the flight; in case of insufficient quality, it is at the tandem pilot\u2019s discretion whether or not to refund the photo and video package price.",

When booking a tandem flight without a gift certificate, the flight price must be paid in cash immediately after completion of the flight.",

    "cancelP2": "The flight guest can, at any time, cancel an agreed upon event date by email to info@danielkofler.com. Cancellation is free of charge up until 3 days before the scheduled date. Cancellations between 2 days and 24 hours before the scheduled date are charged for 50% of the purchase price.
